This is my humble 3D graphics/game engine using a
component-entity-system architecture, written in Rust. There are many
projects like it, but this one is mine.

Don't expect fancy stuff - this is me learning computer graphics,
opengl, and game architecture (and possibly game design?) at the same
time.

# Dependencies

- A graphics card supporting OpenGL (nothing facy needed). Mesa should
be fine.
- `rustc`+`cargo`

# Usage

Using [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo): 

    cargo run
